## Overview

GrowthBook currently supports two levels of integration with most edge workers, including CloudFlare:

1. Our turnkey Edge App

   - Automatically run server-side or hybrid [Visual Experiments](/app/visual) without redraw flicker.
   - Automatically run server-side or hybrid [URL Redirect Experiments](/app/url-redirects) without flicker or delay.
   - Optionally inject the JavaScript SDK with hydrated payload, allowing the front-end to pick up where the edge left off without any extra network requests. We use an enhanced version of our [HTML Script Tag](/lib/script-tag) for this purpose.

2. Support for edge apps using our JavaScript SDK
   - Enhanced support and examples for using our JavaScript SDK in an edge environment

Regardless of your use case, our CloudFlare integration makes easy to synchronize feature and experiment values between GrowthBook and CloudFlare's KV store. This eliminates the network request to the GrowthBook API, unlocking blazingly fast edge-side and client-side SDK performance.

## Worker Configuration

:::tip

This tutorial assumes some familiarity with building and deploying CloudFlare Worker applications. You can quickly get up to speed by following the CloudFlare Workers [Getting Started<ExternalLink />](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/get-started/guide/) guide.

:::

You may either use our turnkey Edge App for CloudFlare Workers or build your own app from scratch using our JavaScript and CloudFlare SDKs.

## Turnkey Edge App

Our Edge App runs as a smart proxy layer between your application and your end users. In absence of Visual or URL Redirect experiments, the Edge App will simply proxy the user request to your site and return the response, optionally injecting a fully-bootstrapped JavaScript SDK onto the rendered HTML page. If the request URL matches an Visual or URL Redirect experiment and the targeting conditions are satisfied, the Edge App may also perform one or more URL redirect behind the scenes (the public-facing URL does not change) and/or mutate the DOM for Visual Experiments.

:::note URL Redirects on edge

The Edge App defaults to running URL Redirect Experiments in the browser only. This is because edge redirects load a separate page's content without altering the URL. After the redirect, some sites may experience problems with loading assets or endpoints with relative paths.attributes

You can enable URL Redirects on edge by setting environment variable `RUN_URL_REDIRECT_EXPERIMENTS` (see below)

:::

Setting up our turnkey Edge App is simple. Assuming that you have a basic Worker application set up, simply install the SDK and implement our custom request handler. Or if you prefer, you may pull down our fully-functional [example implementation<ExternalLink />](https://github.com/growthbook/growthbook-proxy/tree/main/packages/lib/edge-cloudflare/example) and follow along.

### Install the SDK

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @growthbook/edge-cloudflare
```

### Implement the Edge App request handler

A basic implementation of our Edge App only requires a few lines of code:

```ts
import { handleRequest } from "@growthbook/edge-cloudflare";

export default {
  fetch: async function (request, env, ctx) {
    return await handleRequest(request, env);
  },
};
```

### Configure the Edge App

Use a combination of environment variables and optional runtime configuration to add required fields and to customize the Edge App behavior.

#### Environment variables

Edit your `wrangler.toml` file and, at minimum, add these required fields:

```bash
[vars]
PROXY_TARGET="https://www.mysite.io"  # The non-edge URL to your website
GROWTHBOOK_API_HOST="https://cdn.growthbook.io"
GROWTHBOOK_CLIENT_KEY="sdk-abc123"
GROWTHBOOK_DECRYPTION_KEY="key_abc123"  # Only include for encrypted SDK Connections
```

You may want to further customize the app. Here is a list of common customization variables:

```bash
# Disable or change the rendering behavior of Visual Experiments:
# ==========
RUN_VISUAL_EDITOR_EXPERIMENTS="everywhere"|"edge"|"browser"|"skip"  # default: "everywhere"

# URL Redirect Experiments are disabled on edge by default. Because the URL does not change, some sites
# may experience problems with loading assets or endpoints with relative paths:
# ==========
RUN_URL_REDIRECT_EXPERIMENTS="everywhere"|"edge"|"browser"|"skip"  # default: "browser"
RUN_CROSS_ORIGIN_URL_REDIRECT_EXPERIMENTS="everywhere"|"edge"|"browser"|"skip"  # default: "browser"
# Mutate browser URL via window.history.replaceState() to reflect the new URL:
INJECT_REDIRECT_URL_SCRIPT="true"  # default "true".

# Do not inject a bootstrapped JavaScript SDK onto the page:
# ==========
DISABLE_INJECTIONS="true"  # default "false"


# Customize the edge or injected browser SDK behavior:
# ==========
ENABLE_STREAMING="true"  # default "false". Streaming SSE updates on browser.
ENABLE_STICKY_BUCKETING="true"  # default "false". Use cookie-based sticky bucketing on edge and browser.
```

#### Runtime configuration

You may want to provide context to your edge app at runtime rather than using environment variables. For example, if you have additional [targeting attributes](/lib/js#attributes) available, you may inject them by modifying your request handler code:

```ts
import { handleRequest } from "@growthbook/edge-cloudflare";
import { parse } from "cookie";

export default {
  fetch: async function (request, env, ctx) {
    const cookie = parse(request.headers.get("Cookie") || "");
    const config = {
      attributes: {
        userType: cookie["userId"] ? "logged in" : "anonymous"
      }
    };
    return await handleRequest(request, env, config);
  },
};
```

#### More customization options

For a full list of customizations, view our vendor-agnostic [Edge Utility repository<ExternalLink />](https://github.com/growthbook/growthbook-proxy/tree/main/packages/lib/edge-utils).

### Tracking Experiment Views

Running A/B tests requires a [tracking callback](/lib/js#experimentation-ab-testing). Our turnkey Edge App defaults to using built-in front-end tracking. The tracking call automatically integrates with Segment.io, GA4, and Google Tag Manager by using the mechanism outlined in our [HTML Script Tag](/lib/script-tag#tracking-experiment-views). In order to do this, the app keeps track of tracking calls triggered on edge and injects them into the front-end SDK to be automatically triggered on page load.

You may wish to either customize front-end tracking or switch to edge tracking (or use both concurrently if running hybrid edge + front-end experiments).

To change the front-end tracking callback, set the `GROWTHBOOK_TRACKING_CALLBACK` to your custom tracking JS code:

```bash
GROWTHBOOK_TRACKING_CALLBACK="(experiment, results) => { console.log('browser tracking callback', {experiment, results}); }"
```

To track on edge, you must inject your own tracking callback into the edge request handler code. Any experiments that run on edge will use the edge tracking callback and not the front-end callback (hybrid edge + front-end experiments being an exception):

```ts
import { handleRequest } from "@growthbook/edge-cloudflare";

export default {
  fetch: async function (request, env, ctx) {
    const config = {
      edgeTrackingCallback: (experiment, results) => {
        console.log('edge tracking callback', {experiment, results});
      }
    };
    return await handleRequest(request, env, config);
  },
};
```

### Targeting Attributes

The following targeting attributes are set automatically by the Edge App and are available for use.

- `id` - creates a long-lived `gbuuid` cookie if it doesn't exist already
- `url`
- `path`
- `host`
- `query`
- `pageTitle`
- `deviceType` - either `mobile` or `desktop`
- `browser` - one of `chrome`, `edge`, `firefox`, `safari`, or `unknown`

You can customize both the primary identifier name (`id`) and cookie name (`gbuuid`) by setting the `UUID_KEY` and `UUID_COOKIE_NAME` environment variables respectively.

As shown in the [runtime configuration](#runtime-configuration) section above, you can also pass custom attributes via runtime config. You can also skip automatic attribute generation and rely solely on custom attributes by setting the environment variable `SKIP_AUTO_ATTRIBUTES="true"`.

### Routing

By default, the Edge App will process all `GET` requests (other HTTP verbs are proxied through without running through our app logic).

It is generally preferable to configure your routing rules outside of our Edge App. For instance, you may only want to invoke the Edge App at `https://yourdomain.io/landing-page`. You can configure CloudFlare routing by following the CloudFlare Workers [Routes<ExternalLink />](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/routing/routes/) documentation.

There may be situations when you will need to provide finer-grained routing / URL targeting rules within our Edge App. You will need to include a JSON encoded string of route rules in your `ROUTES` environment variable.

For instance, you may want to do a proxy pass-through (do not process) for `mysite.io/account/*` or `mysite.io/settings/*`. Your routes may look like this:

```bash
ROUTES='[{ "pattern":"mysite.io/account/*", "behavior":"proxy" }, { "pattern":"mysite.io/settings/*", "behavior":"proxy" }]'
```

A route uses the following interface, with many of the properties being optional:

```typescript
{
  pattern: string;
  type?: "regex" | "simple";  // default: "simple"
  behavior?: "intercept" | "proxy" | "error";  // default: "intercept"
  includeFileExtensions?: boolean;  // Include requests to filenames like "*.jpg". default: false (pass-through).
  statusCode?: number; // Alter the status code (default is 404 when using "error")
  body?: string; // Alter the body (for setting an error message body)
};
```

When multiple routes are included in your `ROUTES` array, only the first match is used.

### Cookie Policy and GDPR

By default, the Edge App will persist a random unique identifier in a first-party cookie names `gbuuid`. Its purpose is to provide a consistent user experience to your visitors by preventing them from being re-bucketed into different A/B test variations. It follows the same mechanism as discussed in our [HTML Script Tag docs](/lib/script-tag#cookie-policy-and-gdpr).

#### Delay Storing the Cookie Until Consent is Granted

If you must delay persisting the `gbuuid` cookie until a user consents, you can set the environment variable `NO_AUTO_COOKIES="true"`.

This will still generate a UUID for the user, but will not persist it. That means, if the user refreshes the page, they will have a new random UUID generated.environment

You have the option to manually persist this cookie at any time, for example when a user grants consent on your cookie banner. All you need to do is fire this custom event from javascript on the rendered page:

```js
document.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent("growthbookpersist"));
```

:::note

If you are using Sticky Bucketing, a persistent sticky bucket assignments cookie will automatically be generated. If you require user permission before writing cookies, you should:

- Either do not enable Sticky Bucketing on edge (do not use `ENABLE_STICKY_BUCKETING`)
- Or only enable Sticky Bucketing per each user via runtime configuration. (only pass `config.enableStickyBucketing: true` if user has consented — identifiable by checking for presence of the `gbuuid` cookie).

## Manual SDK Integration on Edge

You may be interested in build your own edge application using the GrowthBook SDK and not using our turnkey Edge App. Or you may want to do custom feature flagging on specific routes while running our Edge App on other routes.

To use the GrowthBook on edge, simply include our standard [JavaScript SDK](/lib/js) (`@growthbook/growthbook` NPM package).

In our `@growthbook/edge-cloudflare` NPM package, we export a few CloudFlare-specific utility functions to simplify SDK payload caching.

```ts
import { GrowthBook, setPolyfills } from "@growthbook/growthbook";
import { getKVLocalStoragePolyfill, getPayloadFromKV } from "@growthbook/edge-cloudflare";

// Choose an optional caching strategy

// A. Provide a KV cache layer so that the GrowthBook SDK doesn't need to make as many requests to the GrowthBook API
const localStoragePolyfill = getKVLocalStoragePolyfill(env);
setPolyfills({ localStorage: localStoragePolyfill });

// B. Or use the KV as a managed payload store to eliminate SDK requests to the GrowthBook API entirely
const payload = await getPayloadFromKV(env);
const growthbook = new GrowthBook(gbContext);
await growthbook.init({ payload: payload });
```
